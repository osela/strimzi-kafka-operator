= Resizing persistent volumes

This procedure describes how to increase the size of persistent volumes used by an existing {ProductName} cluster.
This procedure can be applied to clusters using a single persistent volumes as well as to clusters using multiple persistent volumes in a JBOD storage.

NOTE: {ProductPlatformName} currently supports only increasing the size of persistent volumes.
Decreasing the size of persistent volumes is currently not possible.

.Prerequisites

* An {ProductPlatformName} cluster with support for volume resizing
* A running Cluster Operator
* A storage class which supports volume expansion
* A Kafka cluster using persistent volumes created using a given storage class

.Procedure

. Edit the `spec.kafka.storage` or `spec.zookeeper.storage` property in the `Kafka` resource.
Increase the volume size.
For example, change the size of the volume from `1000Gi` to `2000Gi`:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
apiVersion: {KafkaApiVersion}
kind: Kafka
metadata:
  name: my-cluster
spec:
  kafka:
    # ...
    storage:
      type: persistent-claim
      size: 1000Gi
      class: my-storage-class
    # ...
  zookeeper:
    # ...
----
+
. Create or update the resource.
+
ifdef::Kubernetes[]
On {KubernetesName} this can be done using `kubectl apply`:
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
kubectl apply -f _your-file_
+
endif::Kubernetes[]
On {OpenShiftName} this can be done using `oc apply`:
+
[source,shell,subs=+quotes]
oc apply -f _your-file_
+
. The Cluster Operator will request the {ProductPlatformName} to increase the capacity of the persistent volumes.
. Once the persistent volumes are resized, the pods using them need to be restarted in order to resize the file system.
The restart is performed automatically by the Cluster Operator.
